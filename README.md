Installed Bootstrap4 node module into project to make stylings easier

Used LLM Chat GPT 3.5 to generate a set of "vaporwave aethetic styles" and put them in the styles.css folder. I had it build some fun stuff, in particular the .background-gradient-# classes, as well as btn-vapor-primary/warn/success. Feel free to use these or not. For me, I find it easier to keep track of which component I'm looking at when I set them to have unique background colors. If you find the styles too distracting, just comment the whole file out while you're working.

Implemented structure in accordance with Feature Modules from outset to avoid technical debt around optimization
